    <h2>Themes & Style</h2>

    <div class = "card">
      <h3>Spirituality</h3>
      <p>Spirituality is a theme that is present throughout all of Cohen's work, whether in his poetry, his novels or his music. Although he was raised in the Jewish faith, Cohen was fascinated by many forms of religion, such as Christianity and Buddhism. Many of his songs, such as Hallelujah (1984) and Suzanne (1968), contain biblical references and religious imagery. However, Cohen was not creating his works to preach his beliefs. Instead, he used spirituality to explain the human experience, especially in regards to pain and love.</p>
    </div>

    <div class = "card">
      <h3>Love</h3>
      <p>Within his work, Cohen delves into all aspects of love, focusing on romantic longing, the expression of sexuality and heartbreak. Rather than concentrating on the beautiful aspects of love, he highlights its human nature and how it can often be painful. Many of his songs depict broken relationships and complicated emotions. He also used spirituality to explore the idea of love, frequently comparing his lovers to divine beings who offer more than an earthly connection. Overall, Cohen demonstrates that love is agonizing and complex but essential to the human experience.</p>
    </div>

    <div class = "card">
      <h3>Loss</h3>
      <p>The idea of loss, along with the emotions of pain and suffering that come with it, is a recurring theme in Cohen's work. His stories and songs often depict a lover who has passed, a relationship that has ended or the loss of spiritual connection. Cohen uses the concept of loss to explore the uncomfortable reality of grief, portraying it as a natural part of life. He frames the experience as a transformative period for his characters. Cohen reminds his audience that, although painful, loss is a necessary element that shapes us as humans.</p>
    </div>

    <div class = "card">
      <h3>Redemption</h3>
      <p>The theme of redemption is closely tied to Cohen's themes of love and loss. It is never simple and is typically earned through the experience of suffering. Cohen presents a realistic view of redemption, showing that even the most damaged individuals are capable of achieving it. For example, in his song Anthem (1992), he writes, "There is a crack, a crack in everything / That's how the light gets in," suggesting that despite one's imperfections, there is always hope. Cohen emphasizes the importance of redemption and uses his work to offer comfort to those who may be suffering.</p>
